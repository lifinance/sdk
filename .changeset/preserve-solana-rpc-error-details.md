Preserve Solana RPC error details on failed transactions. The structured `err` payload (and `logs`, for simulation failures) from a failed simulation or confirmation is now attached to the thrown `TransactionError`'s `cause` as a new `SolanaTransactionDetailsError`, so consumers can inspect the original error and logs directly without re-simulating. `SolanaTransactionDetailsError` is exported from the package root.
